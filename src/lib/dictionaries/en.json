It was such a relief when I spoke to Manuel who explained everything in detail and answered all of my questions thoroughly. Manuel did not have to do all this because I was technically not his client, but he did all of this anyway just to put my mind at ease. I felt comfortable and more relaxed after speaking to Manuel and he was with us every step of the way. He never hesitated to answer any of our questions and was always a phone call away. My family and I appreciate everything Manuel did for us and for making this process so smooth. Look no further, Manuel will always be your guy!"

Who has final say for specific business decisions? What happens if an owner dies or becomes incapacitated? What happens if one owner wants to sell their share of the business? All these questions and more should be in your operating agreement. You do not want to open yourself up to having to invest money and time litigating matters that could have already been agreed on in the operating agreement.

          "description": "A powers of attorney is basically formal documents allowing another person (called an “agent”) to legally act on your behalf. They are quite versatile and may be tailored to grant less power to your agent. A power of attorney can be a convenient solution when you need to do something, but you do not have the time to do so. For instance, with the right power of attorney, your agent can negotiate and sign contracts on your behalf or access and sell property in your name. Of course, this would only make sense if the agent is someone who you unconditionally trust and has your best interests at heart. One smart use of a power of attorney is granting someone you love and trust access to all your accounts so they can care for you if you ever become incapacitated.

          "description": "A prenuptial (also called “premarital”) or postnuptial (also called “postmarital”) agreement is where the spouses formally agree on financial matters in case a divorce ever happens. A prenuptial agreement is done before the marriage while a postnuptial agreement is done after the marriage. Where there is a marriage, there can always be divorce. Formalizing a prenuptial or postnuptial agreement can be a good idea because a divorce can have an effect on your finances for the rest of your life. When a divorce happens, a judge decides how to divide up everything and how much to pay in alimony. A good prenuptial or postnuptial agreement frequently removes the judge’s criteria from the equation and protects the spouses’ true intentions.

On July 3, 2023, he founded his own law practice: Manuel Alejandro Law Firm, LLC. Manuel brings passion and dedication to his profession and is devoted to achieving the best possible results for his clients.",
          "Manuel excelled in law school and was given an award from the Institute of Law Development (“Instituto para el Desarrollo del Derecho”) for having the highest cumulative grade point average of the graduating class in all criminal law courses. Similarly, the Puerto Rico College of Attorneys (“Colegio de Abogados de Puerto Rico”) conferred the Benicio Sánchez Castaño Award on him for his academic excellence in criminal law courses.",
          "Days after passing the Puerto Rico Bar Exam, he was offered a valuable opportunity to work as law clerk to the Hon. Daniel R. Domínguez in the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico, which was where he worked as a law student. During this period, Manuel researched and drafted countless opinions and orders, many of which are published, on a variety of intricate legal issues in all types of criminal and civil cases. Fortunately, none of these opinions were overturned on appeal. During this time, Manuel was able to learn how to see cases and attorneys from a judge’s perspective, which is a very important skill to have when building, arguing, and litigating a case. Most importantly, Manuel was in a position to properly assess and adopt the most effective litigation strategies from different attorneys to be used for his own future clients.",
          "Thereafter, Manuel became an Assistant State Attorney in Florida’s Seventh Judicial Circuit. His colleagues still tease him about this because the change required that he unnecessarily take an enormous pay cut. However, Manuel was committed to using his position as a prosecutor to try and help bring justice to all. Only days after being hired, he was called to prosecute hundreds of cases at a time, which required almost daily participation in court, thorough investigative skills, and tireless trial preparation. He was assigned dozens of new cases a week and was responsible for evaluating, investigating, filing, arguing, and trying all these cases if necessary. This tenure taught Manuel how to think on his feet in court and properly investigate and prepare a case for trial. Manuel now uses each of these skills to fight for his clients.",
          "Subsequently, Manuel began working in private practice. Throughout this time, he litigated many types of civil, criminal, appellate, administrative, and arbitration. These included cases in several states and jurisdictions, both in the state and federal forums. He also drafted contracts, powers of attorney, settlement agreements, and various other extrajudicial documents. Manuel negotiated favorable resolutions in both the criminal and civil context and had the opportunity to represent well-known clients in a myriad of cases.",
          "Manuel speaks and writes fluently in English and Spanish. He has a multicultural background and has lived in the United States, Puerto Rico, and Colombia. Some of his hobbies are watching movies, cooking, and playing chess. He is an outside-the-box thinker and is committed to achieving the best possible outcome for his clients."
